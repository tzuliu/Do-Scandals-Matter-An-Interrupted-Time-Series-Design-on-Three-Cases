# In this repository:

1. `German(Overall).R`---This file is for generating the time-series approval data of **_CDU/CSU_** and **_FDP_** after **2000**. Furthermore, this file can also generating the overall distribution of the approval data of **_CDU/CSU_** and **_FDP_**.

2. `German(Overall).R.ipynb`---This file provides the results of `German(Overall).R` through notebook.

3. `UK(Overall).R`---This file is for generating the time-series approval data of **_the Consevative_** and **_the Labour_** after **2000**. Furthermore, this file can also generating the overall distribution of the approval data of **_the Labour_**.

4. `UK(Overall).R.ipynp`---This file provides the results of `UK(Overall).R` through notebook.

5. Use `ErrorTerm Generation.R` to generate the error terms for each party before moving on. **Note:** The error component in the original data sets is generated by Normal distribution of mean=0 and std=3.394. However, since the **FDP**'s poll is low during the time period this project examines, I instead set the **sampling error** as the standard error of the error term, which means the DGS follows a Normal distribution of mean=0 and std=sqrt{(*p*(1-*p*))/600}, where *p* is the average approval rate within a given election cycle.

6. `German(CDU)2M1.R`---This file provides the plot of distribution, tests regarding stationarity and the DGS, the plot of the OLS results, and the plot of break points.

7. `German(CDU)2M1.R.ipynb`---This file provides the results of `German(CDU)2M1.R` through notebook.
